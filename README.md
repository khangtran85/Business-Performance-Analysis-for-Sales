# PBI-Manufacturing
This project involves visualizing the AdventureWorks2019 dataset using Power BI, with a focus on the manufacturing perspective. Key metrics such as production efficiency, inventory levels, and work order performance are highlighted, offering valuable insights to optimize manufacturing processes and improve operational decision-making.
# Introduction
The Production Division serves as a cornerstone in the company's operational pipeline, entrusted with the responsibility of fulfilling production requests initiated by the Planning Department. This intricate workflow begins with the Procurement Department, which sources and stocks the necessary raw materials in designated warehouses. Upon securing the required inputs, the production process is activated, leading to the manufacturing of finished goods. To streamline logistics and customer distribution, these products are strategically stored across various locations.

However, the production workflow is not without its challenges. Delays often arise when the actual completion time deviates from the planned schedule, impacting downstream operations. During the quality inspection of incoming inventory, damaged or defective products may be identified and excluded from storage to ensure that only high-quality items are retained for future distribution. Such complexities necessitate a data-driven approach to monitor, analyze, and optimize operations for seamless execution.
# Objectives
- *Monitoring Production Performance:* Track the progress of production orders and identify deviations between planned timelines and actual completion dates.

- *Inventory Management:* Provide real-time insights into inventory levels across multiple storage locations, highlighting discrepancies or potential quality issues, such as defective or damaged products.

- *Operational Decision-Making:* Facilitate proactive decision-making by presenting key metrics and trends in a visually accessible manner.
# Processing
## Data Collection:
The AdventureWorks2019 dataset is a comprehensive and widely recognized sample database released by Microsoft. It is designed to emulate the complex business operations of a multinational manufacturing and distribution company, making it an essential tool for learning and practice in the realms of SQL Server, Business Intelligence (BI), and data analysis. As the most recent version in the AdventureWorks series, it builds upon previous iterations to offer a detailed and realistic dataset that supports educational and professional applications, including database design, query optimization, and advanced analytics.

The AdventureWorks database portrays a fictional company that specializes in producing and selling a variety of products, including bicycles, bicycle parts, sportswear, and other related goods. The company operates on a global scale, catering to a diverse customer base and maintaining partnerships with suppliers and distributors across multiple geographic regions. With data covering a wide range of business processes, such as sales, purchasing, manufacturing, and human resources, AdventureWorks provides a rich environment for exploring the complexities of enterprise-level data management and decision-making. This makes it an invaluable resource for both beginners and advanced users aiming to deepen their understanding of real-world business scenarios and technical solutions.
